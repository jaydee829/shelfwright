"""Two-phase enrichment service (Lift 2 Stage 3).

Fast pass: API scouts only (seconds) — persist the Work + log the read immediately.
Deep pass: the slow LLM scouts, run later by the Cloud Tasks internal endpoint, which
re-persists (updates) the SAME Work. Reuses the shared persist_enriched_work so the
catalog is built identically to the ETL and discovery paths (DRY).

Both passes run their scouts (external HTTP/LLM calls) with NO database session held
(GH #94) — a short read session first, then the scouts, then a fresh write session that
re-checks dedup before persisting (the #95 TOCTOU window is back to milliseconds instead
of the scouts' full duration).

This is a parallel surface to mcp/server.py's enrich_and_persist_work (the all-scouts
discovery write tool). enrich_and_persist_work now ROUTES THROUGH enrich_fast (not left
untouched — corrected, final review Minor 6), so it is covered by enrich_fast's
pg_advisory_xact_lock dedup guard the same as every other fast-pass caller: same persist
core, tiered scouts."""

    at enrich-queue concurrency 4, where a late transient failure also re-paid every LLM
    call), then re-persist in a fresh session.

    GH #141: the write session's persist_enriched_work re-checks dedup by SCOUT-CANONICAL
    identity (title + author as the scouts now report them), which can differ from the
    invoked work's own (possibly dirty) identity and resolve to a DIFFERENT existing Work
    — the invoked row's twin. This is not undone (the persist legitimately lands on the
    twin — it's the same book); refusing would require re-plumbing persist_enriched_work's
    many callers for zero data benefit. Instead the redirect is recorded in
    detected_duplicates (the works-merge tool's feed) and the INVOKED row is stamped, so
    the requeue sweep stops re-listing it (closing the paid-pass-burning loop).

    Returns one of:
      "missing"    — no Work has that id, or it has no linked Author (non-retryable). Also
                     returned (final-review Minor 7 honesty fix) if the write session's
                     persist_enriched_work returns None — nothing was persisted and
                     deep_enriched_at was never stamped, so "done" would be a lie; "missing"
                     tells the caller (api/internal.py) this is non-retryable the same way an
                     already-gone Work is, rather than falsely reporting success. Also
                     returned (PR #126 review) if the empty-path stamp session finds the Work
                     gone — it was deleted while the slow scouts were running with no session
                     held. Also returned (#141) if the redirect path's re-load of the invoked
                     row by id finds it gone — same deleted-mid-pass honesty rule.
      "empty"      — the scouts yielded nothing to add this pass, and the Work still exists. A
                     SHORT session stamps work.deep_enriched_at = now() anyway (GH #97): the
                     timestamp means "the deep pass COMPLETED", including confirmed-empty — the
                     caller (api/internal.py) decides retryability from the work's real-trope
                     state, not from this string alone. An exception raised before this point
                     propagates uncaught, leaving deep_enriched_at unstamped so Cloud Tasks
                     retries the whole pass.
      "done"       — the scouts found something AND the write session actually persisted +
                     stamped deep_enriched_at on the SAME Work in the SAME session.
      "redirected" — (#141) the scouts found something, but persist landed it on a DIFFERENT
                     existing Work (the twin) instead of the invoked one. The invoked row is
                     stamped deep_enriched_at (the pass DID complete) and a detected_duplicates
                     row is recorded; the twin's data is untouched by this function beyond
                     persist's own write. Non-retryable success — see api/internal.py.

    Reviewer-found bug (fixed here): the redirect branch used to INSERT the detected_duplicates
    row (work_id_a=work_id) BEFORE re-loading the invoked work by id. If the invoked row had
    been deleted mid-pass, that insert FK-violated on work_id_a, and the raised exception rolled
    back the WHOLE write session — including the twin's already-`persist`ed pass data in the
    same transaction — even though the function documents a clean "missing" return for exactly
    this case. The existence check now runs FIRST, before any write, so a vanished invoked row
    takes the "missing" path without touching the twin's legitimately-persisted data. Residual:
    there is still a TOCTOU window between this get() and the session's eventual commit — the
    invoked row could be deleted in that gap and the FK violation is possible in principle, but
    it is now a millisecond window instead of spanning the full scout call, matching the same
